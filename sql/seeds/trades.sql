-- Sample trade data (this would typically be populated by the application)
-- This file is intentionally left mostly empty as trade data is real-time data
-- that should be populated by the live data collection system

-- You can add sample trade data here if needed for testing:
-- INSERT INTO trades (
--     symbol, trade_id, timestamp, price, quantity, quote_quantity, is_buyer_maker
-- ) VALUES (
--     'BTCUSDT', 123456789, EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM NOW()) * 1000, 35200.00, 0.025, 880.00, false
-- );

-- Note: Use EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM NOW()) * 1000 for current timestamp in milliseconds
